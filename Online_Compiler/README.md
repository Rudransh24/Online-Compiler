React Application 
--> Online Compiler

This project involves creation of a npm package. We tend to use a function call from App.js to Compiler.js which is nothing but the actual source code for the react application.
We get our free API key (Online Judge) and use basic 4 states: Input, Output, Language Input and User Input.
